/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the demo application tasks.
 *
 * Main. c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task that does not flash an LED maintains a unique count that is
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The
 * check task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles an LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time the LED toggle
 * will stop.
 *
 * The LED flash and communications test tasks do not maintain a count.

/*
Changes from V1.2.0
	
	+ Changed the baud rate for the serial test from 19200 to 57600.

Changes from V1.2.3

	+ The integer and comtest tasks are now used when the cooperative scheduler
	  is being used.  Previously they were only used with the preemptive
	  scheduler.

Changes from V1.2.5

	+ Set the baud rate to 38400.  This has a smaller error percentage with an
	  8MHz clock (according to the manual).

Changes from V2.0.0

	+ Delay periods are now specified using variables and constants of
	  portTickType rather than unsigned long.

Changes from V2.2.0

	+ File can now be built using either the IAR or WinAVR compiler.

Changes from V2.6.1

	+ The IAR and WinAVR AVR ports are now maintained separately.

Changes from V4.0.5

	+ Modified to demonstrate the use of co-routines.
